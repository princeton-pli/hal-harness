PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

{problem_steps_str}

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

{next_step_str}

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

{dependencies}

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. Write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
3. Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
4. DO NOT include previous function code, example usage or test code in your response.
5. Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.

Example:
```python

[Insert the Python code here based on the provided function header and dependencies.]
